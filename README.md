This repository contains starter files for the code you need to write for Lab 8:
- `addresses.py`: Put your code for Question 1 ("Addresses") in this file.
- `vehicles.py`: Put your code for Question 2 ("Vehicles"), Question 4 ("Vans"), and Question 5 ("Helicopters") in this file.
- `tasks.py`: Put your code for Question 3 ("Tasks") in this file.

It also contains code that you should understand (and probably use) but not modify. This code can be found in `dispatcher.py` and `oscar.py`.

It also contains visualization code that you need not look at and should not modify. This code can found in `graphics.py` and `manhattan.py`.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) any other files in this repository.
